StockBot API

A REST CRUD API for the data found used in Politician Stock Tracker (AKA StockBot). This project can also be found on my GitHub. 

Currently supports GET and POST for the trades, members, and stocks tables

Can be run using the command: python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Use http://localhost:8000/docs to try it out!
